### Documentation

Write documentation for your functions, modules and whatever you need.

### Tests

Write tests. Try to get the maximum coverage as you can.

### Write a parallel function

Create a parallel function to generate a report using the files `report_1.csv`, `report_2.csv` and `report_3.csv`
